Overview
-------
Welcome to Eorzea, a land of great adventure, terrible danger, and new friends. Explore the deepest darkest dungeons, 
build the perfect home, find valuable treasure, or try to fish up the big one. Whatever you do, it's your choice.

Story
-------
Eorzea is finally recovering from the calamity. The three great city states are rebuilding from the ruins caused by the elder primal Bahamut. But now, 
something threatens this new-found peace. The technologically advanced Garlean Empire threatens to invade and take advantage of this period of weakness. 
The primals are reawakening and draining the land if it's life. Can you rise up and protect the realm? Can you become a Warrior of Light?

Classes
-------
Final Fantasy XIV offers a wide range of classes, and a unique system. Start out as a simple gladiator, but prove your worth and become a full fledged paladin!
Classes range from the Black Mage who casts powerful damaging spells from afar, to the Dragoon who leaps through the air to impale foes, to the Scholar who uses
ancient magic to keep allies in good shape. If combat isn't your thing, there are also a wide range of crafting and gathering classes such as Botanist, 
Goldsmith, Carpenter, and Fisher. 

Social
-------
There are tons of ways to interact with the community. You can make a Free Company, and take down tough challenges or make the perfect home base. You 
can make a linkshell so you can talk no matter the distance, or you can hang out at the Golden Saucer and try some of the minigames. The Party Finder
will help you find the perfect team to take down that dragon. If you're more of a loner type, the Duty Finder can automatically put you in a team!
